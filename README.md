# COBOL-File-Example
## _My first text file operations COBOL program_

COBOL File-Example is a COBOL program that writes text to a file based on User input.

- Written in COBOL on VSCode
- ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- Text file is automatically created if it does not exist.
- FILLER is used for formatting. This is a simple text file that is created.

This program was compiled using the open-source GnuCOBOL.
Link --> [GnuCOBOL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucobol/)

> The main goal of this program was to test my knowledge
> The main issue with COBOL is trying to compile/run locally
> and without the need for a mainframe.

## How to compile/run the file

Once you have downloaded GnuCOBOL. Copy and Paste this program file in there.

Click on the ```set_env.cmd``` file

Type:
```sh
cobc -x file-example.cbl
```

The compiler will output nothing if everything went well.

Final step is to type:
```sh
file-example
```

That's it :)
